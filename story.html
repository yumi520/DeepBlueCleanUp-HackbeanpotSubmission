            <h3>How can you help?</h3>
            <p>Cleanups can help increase awareness about
                 the extent of cigarette butt pollution and why it’s 
                 important to stop cigarette litter. Cigarette litter will 
                 end when tobacco use does. That means changing the culture around tobacco.
                 Eliminating cigarette litter for good also means helping smokers quit. </p>

        <div class="plasticbag-text hidden funfact">
            <h3>How can you help?</h3>
            <p>Thousands of marine animals choke and die from ingesting this plastic, and 
                many more are being slowly poisoned by the dioxin and other pollutants introduced 
                by this mass of plastic. Dioxin is an endocrine disrupter because it causes gender 
                mutations in fish and land animals that eat fish, like sea bass, seals, and even polar bears.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="straw-text hidden funfact">
            <h3>How can you help?</h3>
            <p>If you’re able to, request your cold drink is made without a single-use plastic straw. It’s 
                important that you state this before your drink is made; if the straw is already in there when 
                it’s brought to you, it’ll likely become plastic waste anyway.

                You can also bring your own sustainable 
                alternatives. There are stainless steel, bamboo, and glass options available on the market!</p>

        <div class="sixpackring-text hidden funfact">
            <h3>How can you help?</h3>
            <p> Don't buy soda in cans. Buy glass bottles instead. They are not only much healthier for you 
                (cans are believed to leach aluminium into the drink), they can also be recycled and re-used. 
                And, of course, they don't come with those dangerous plastic holders.
                
                Of course, always put your trash in the bins, don't leave anything at the beach. It will almost 
                certainly end up in the ocean.</p>

        <div class="metal-text hidden funfact">
            <h3>How can you help?</h3>
            <p>One of the reasons that improper metal scrap recycling can harm the ocean environment is that it 
                can pollute beautiful beaches, coastline and dive sites worldwide.
                If we were to recycle all pieces of scrap metal that we could, rather than wasting it or loitering, 
                there would be less need for landfill sites.</p>

        <div class="plasticwaterbottle-text hidden funfact">
            <h3>How can you help?</h3>
            <p> Carry a reusable bottle in your bag! 
                Cook more! Not only is it healthier, but making your own meals doesn’t involve takeout 
                containers. Buy in bulk! Yogurts, toiletries, tiny packages of 
                nuts—consider the product-to-packaging ratio of items you tend to buy often and select the bigger container 
                instead of buying several smaller ones over time.</p>
